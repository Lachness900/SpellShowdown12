# SpellShowdown12
My first project in year 8 in which I created a 2d platformer for school over 3 months
I worked on it as a group project in which the other people made assets(Credit:Tristan Morsan, James Ferry), and I did the unity code and structuring

The unity version used is 2018.3.0f2 
However, many features of the project are unstable because of the old build and the use of the collab feature

A built version would exist if it didn't always throw an error for no reason (I can play it on my own computer in the editor, so I assume it's unity being werid)
So instead this is all the c# scripts used in the game. 
I copied alot from the internet cause I wasn't sure what I was doing but it came together well in the end(sort of).
